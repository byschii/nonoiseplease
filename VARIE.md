# TODO

## PRE-RELEASE
- fix ui on extention with msgs
- test search with categories from web page
- explore test of extention
- import bookmarks
- test proxies
- remove 'extension token' from ui and schema

## NICE TO HAVE
- in extention, when showing results, put link to internal page management
    - example: http://127.0.0.1:8090/me/pages/manage.html?id=3jzdp04qbakw3xz
- in extention: if browser in chrome: suggest firefox
- persist user activity
    - also make it available to user
