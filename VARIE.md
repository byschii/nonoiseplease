# TODO

## PRE-RELEASE
- fix ui on web page (maybe with a menu on top)
- controllare regole
- https://github.com/securego/gosec

## NICE TO HAVE
- in extention, when showing results, put link to internal page management
    - example: http://127.0.0.1:8090/me/pages/manage.html?id=3jzdp04qbakw3xz
- persist user activity
    - also make it available to user
- optional do not save double urls
- code test for extension
    - maybe with pyautogui
- when page added to web > link a edit (?)
