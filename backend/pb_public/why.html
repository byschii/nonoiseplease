            Why
        </h2>
        <h3>
            1 needed a better way to sort my bookmarks
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have always thought that every day I come across sections of the web that are particularly interesting, and I always try to save them for later use... in my bookmarks. However, the "later use" never actually came, and I kept thinking, "Damn, there must be some hidden gems buried deep in my browser bookmarks." <br />
            I'm simply to lazy to go and search my bookmarks every time i "suppose" i have something usefull <br />
            So, I decided to create a tool that could scrape/index/store what i find interesting on the web and serve it back to me when i google something (Google is not thrown out the window) Then, I realized that this tool could be useful for others as well. After all, I can't be the only one who still uses bookmarks to save everything in an unsorted manner. <br />
        </p>
        <h3>
            2 google sucks
        </h3>
        <p>
            Google sometimes is shit. I think it's trying to help me, but i have the feeling the web is too big/complex and google doesn't know me well enought, so it just serves stupid ads without giving me great results. <br />
            SEO is a bit annoying. (i m not an expert, but) i think that guys that writes best blogs don't care about SEO... so i cimply cant find them.<br />
            That makes (i) finding great resources and (ii) retrieving some niche page I found while surfing very difficult.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3 ai is flooding the web with garbage
        </h3>
        <p>
            Part of me is scared by the "Dead Internet Theory", part of me thinks that if an LLM writes usefull content i should take it as usefull. <br />
            That said, i feel the urge to scrape my own web and don't let google index it for me. Maybe, in a distant future, the web will come back to something like Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web (a human-edited web directory)<br />
